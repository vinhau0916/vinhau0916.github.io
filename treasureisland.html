		The Treasure Island is located next to the Oakland Bridge. It was created for the 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition, it was celebrating in part the completion of both the Golden Gate (1937) and San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridges (1936). People can get there by car and the muni 108 bus line, departing for the Transbay Terminal. What so special about Treasure Island is that it has stunning views, where you can see the entire northern waterfront of San Francisco. Also, the island has hosted many events and festivals such as Treasure Island Music Festival and the San Francisco Dragon Boat Festival. There are two popular Island’s restaurants, T.I Bar and Grill and Oasis Cafe. 

		I have been here many times. I am attracted by its great night view, especially. Sometimes, I like to come here with friends to get some fresh air, to have a conversation, to contemplate the SF’s night views, to listen to a sound of an ocean, and to look at a sky of full of stars. I am an introvert, so I’d love spend rest of my night at place like this. Calm and quiet, that is how I recharge my energy after a long day of school and work.
