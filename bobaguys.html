		<p>The boba store has been established in summer 2013 by two Asian guys name Bin and Andrew. What caused them to open the boba business was that a boba shop that they used to visit had closed down. Then they came up with an idea to start a boba business, and they built it from scratch. They said, “We didn’t have a business plan. We didn’t have a customer base. We didn’t even have a proper kitchen.” They want to make a difference and change people view about boba, and tea. Now they have expanded in many different locations around San Francisco: Stockton, Octavia, 16th St, 19th St, Fillmore St, and Divisadero St.

		The reasons why I chose this shop over other many boba shops as my favorite in San Francisco because of the standard of their products such as the taste of drinks, the sweetness and chewy of boba, and quality of services. All these features blend in have made a perfect cup of drink. That is why a line is always long, and I always have to wait about 30 minutes in line to order. But that is worth it.
