		<p>This Reimx Collage image demonstrates the different aspects between a life of an adult and a life of a child. When you are a child, you are free of expressions. When you are happy, you smile. When you are sad, you cry. You are not afraid of anyone to judge you. However, when you become an adult. The way you view of life has changed. You are less open to the society and afraid to show your real emotions. You incline to hide it behind your unknown smile because you don't want the society to judge or see the weak sides of you.</p>
