		Fort Point was built with the purpose to protection the San Francisco Bay Area during Civil War between 1853 to 1861. The Fort was built with the Third System style was adopted in 1820s to protect the commercial and military installation from foreign attack. After the Civil War, the Fort Point was remodeled as a detention barracks. Then during WWII, Fort Point became a station used to guard submarine attack from enemy. In the late 1930, Chief Engineer Joseph Strauss constructed the Golden Gate Bridge over the Fort Point. On October 16, 1970, Fort Point became a National Historic Site. 

		I came to Fort Point for the first time. At first my plan was to find a location where I could see the Golden Gate Bridge closely and took pictures of it. When I came to a site, I realized there an abandoned building under the bridge. Due to my curiosity, I went to explore a building right after I took pictures of the bridge and an ocean. When I saw how majestic and mysterious from inside, I was kind of scared and excited, simultaneously. At a ground level, I could see rows of cannons that used in military. Then at second and third level, a site exhibited galleries, statues, and photos of soldiers who sacrificed to protect the Bay Area here. It was a great day for me because I have  been able to gain new knowledge about my favorite city.
