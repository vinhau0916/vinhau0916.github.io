		This is the recreation and park located on Moraga and 14th Ave in San Francisco. At this location, the park has stunning views from downtown San Francisco and Golden Gate Park to Pt. Reyes and around to Lake Merced. On top of a hill, there is a 140-million-year-old rock called Franciscan Chert, which was formed when the region was part of the ancient sea floor. Around the park area, there are diverse plant’s species such as bush lupine, dune tansy, beach strawberry, bush monkey flower, and coyote brush.)

		The reason I chose this park because of its particular features that different with other parks. I have been here multiple times, but I still want to come back here if I have free time. Before you want to see the whole San Francisco’s scenery from the top, you have to willing to climb up high stairs. After you get on the top, you will be amazed by stunning spectacle, where you can contemplate 720 degree view around San Francisco. You can see part of the Golden Gate Bridge as well as a part of an ocean from very far away. It is very windy and cold breeze here, but I like that atmosphere. Especially if you are sunset lover, this is the best choice to watch sunset. Also, if you are a photographer, you should try out this place.
