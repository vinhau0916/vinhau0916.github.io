	<center><h1>I am Vinh Au</h1></center>

	<p>Let's me introduce myself at first. I am Vinh Au, and I am currently going to San Jose State University. I am working to achieve the Bachelor of Fine Arts program of Digital Media Art. Since I was born, I had a special love for art. I loved drawing, and playing with crayons when I was a kid. When I grow up, the point of view of I look at art also has expanded. I started to get to know about music, fashion, photograph, painting, animation, movie, and so on. On the way of figuring out about my dream, I have attempted to take many different areas of art field such as Photograph class, Fashion Design class, and Graphic Design. I only figured out what my goal, recently. That was a moment after I watched an animation movie called Coco. It was a such amazing movie. It gave me a beautiful message about chasing my dream despite of what circumstance I am in, just like a character in a movie. Besides of that message, I also got attracted by the designs of the characters, background, gestures, movements, and musics. Every of these elements blends into each other has created such wonderful movie. While I was watching that movie, I was so touched and said to myself one day there will be a beautiful movie like this will have my name on it. Therefore, I decided to major in Digital Media Art. I love to produce the products that could bring emotions to the audiences. I love to see my audiences smile as they watching happy scenes, and I love to see them shredding tears as sad scenes come up. So that is what I am aiming for.</p>
