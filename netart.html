	<p>This is my Net Art page. This page will tell you little bit about mysself. San Francsico, I would say, is my favorite city. I have been to Los Angeles, Napa, Santa Cruz, and many more places. However, San Francisco has its own unique beauty and attractive that really captures my heart. I would say I always have left my heart back there whenever I leave the city. These are four of my many other favorite places that you will explore by clicking on the symbol. There are Boba Guys, Fort Point, Grandview Park, and Treasure Island. If you are curious and want to know more informations about these places, it is your job to explore them out. Click on the <a href="map">Go to Map and Start to Explore.</a> But if you are not ready, you can click <a href="index.html">Go Home.</a></p>

	<p>For this project, I use Sublime Text to generate the code in html, and css. Then I use Github to make my local website to go online.</p>
