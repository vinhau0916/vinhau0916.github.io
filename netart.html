	<p align="left">This is my Net Art page. The front page is gif image of the Golden Gate Bridge with some moving boats during a rainy and foggy day. This page will tell you little bit more about me. San Francsico, I would say, is my favorite city. So far, I have been to Los Angeles, Napa, Santa Cruz, and many more places. However, San Francisco has its own unique beauty and attractive that really captures my heart. I would say I always have left my heart back in the city whenever I have to leave. The city is so dreamy and beautiful. There are a lot of shopping malls, restaurants, boba shops, and so on. On my website, I will take you to the four of my many favorite places. You will explore by dragging a mouse and around to look for hidden symbols. There are a popular boba drink store called Boba Guys, a National Historical Site called Fort Point, a park that on top of the hill called Grandview Park, and a separate island between San Francisco and Oakland called Treasure Island. If you are curious and want to know more informations about these places, it is your job to explore them out. There will be locations will be updated soon in the future.
